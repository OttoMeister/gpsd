# gpsd
Linux gpsd programming in c laguage using "GPSD_SHARED_MEMORY"


Just a bit c programming for my rasp car dash cam. Runs also fine on my Desktop. Using 5$ gps-usb sticks from aliexpress.

Sorry for my motion.c with gpsd support. It is a realy dirty hack and should not be published. But it works just fine in my car :)
